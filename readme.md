Multer is a tool in Node.js used to handle file uploads. When users upload files (like images or documents) through a form on a website, Multer helps process those files and store them on the server.


 // Advanced method & New used method
    // Use of method (some) =  method checks whether at least one element in an array satisfies a provided condition. This is useful when you need to verify if any item in a list meets a specific criterion. 

AccessToken & Refresh Token => Basically AccessToken is short leaved, And that is used to not repeatedly give the email and password from the user 
AccessToken Basically for 1 day token which is after one day they have to again give the user id and password to continue the process (It is basically a short term of 16 - 30 min or max to max 1 day -> and again refresh and regenrate this)

Refresh Token / session storage => (it will store in the database) if the user have notification of 401 that is your token is expire so the frontend task is to give the message to hit a end point and then refresh and generate one new Token (How to regenrate -> to check your token and one which is store in my data base if match then regenrate the token)
